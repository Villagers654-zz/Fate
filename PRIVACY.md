such as server permissions, (this data is only stored in cache
while the bot is running).

### Data Storage
All stored data is kept on protected servers. While storage methods vary, most data is kept within password-protected
databases such as MySQL, and MongoDB. Please keep in mind that even with these protections, no data can ever be 100%
secure. All efforts are taken to keep your data secure and private, but its absolute security cannot be guaranteed.

### Feedback
Feedback on the bot is appreciated. When you submit comments, suggestions, bug reports, and any other forms of
feedback, you forego any rights to the content, title, or intent of the provided feedback. Additionally, the feedback
may be utilized in any way.

document. In addition, you (the server manager) are agreeing to inform your members of the
[Developer Terms of Service](https://discordapp.com/developers/docs/legal), and the contents of this document.
If you, the server manager, do not agree to this document, you may remove the bot from the server. If you, the server
member, do not agree to this document, you may leave the server that contains the bot.
